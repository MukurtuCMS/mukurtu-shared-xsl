This MARC-Mukurtu mapping was documented when the Ancestral Voices/1890 Passamaquoddy Phonograph Recordings collection held at the Library of Congress American Folklife Center (AFC) was shared back with the Passamaquoddy Nation. The mapping was collaboratively developed and approved by representatives from both organizations. The mapping was used for a one-way transfer from the AFC's MARC records into the Passamaquoddy People Mukurtu site.

The mapping consists of one entry for each Mukurtu field, with notes about which MARC field(s) map to it, any necessary modifications to the content of the MARC field(s), and specific formatting needs for Mukurtu import.
